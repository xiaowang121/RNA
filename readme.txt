1.What is RNA Base Interactions Prediction?
	RNA base interactions is a means of assisting RNA structure prediction, and accurate prediction of RNA base interactions can improve the performance of structure prediction model.
2.How to configure the environment?

	Anaconda is recommended to set up Pytorch environments
	Python3.7 with numpy and numba should be installed
	Pytorch-1.5.1 (https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) 
	cuda = 10.2
	
3.Datasets.
	Pdataset: 
		You can obtain the protein sequences of the train set and test set in the Pdataset folder
	Rdataset: 
		We get it from http://yanglab.nankai.edu.cn/RNAcontact/

4. Experimental code
	The codes of this task are uploaded for reference.
